# Sans Columns

This is a CSS framework that's meant to be incredibly easy to use. The lack of certain features is **intentional**. The point of this framework is simplicity to use and maintain. If you need high flexibility and a ton of implemented features please use something like [bootstrap]() or [bulma]()

## Basic concept

The idea with this system is that all your content is inside a body element, from there you can use the classes semantically to determine what you need.

## Layout

Container sizing:

- full: Takes up 100% of the container (but will not bleed outside of it)
- thirds
- halfs
- three-quarters
- full-bleeds: Takes up 100% of the container and will bleed it outside of it
