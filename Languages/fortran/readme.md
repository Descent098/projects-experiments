Fortran is arguably the first (of the third generation or not assembly languages) to be imperative. Developed in the 1950's it was originally designed to be written on punch-cards. However it was originally closed source, and was opened in ~2003[^1]. It's original specification had a total of 32 statements[^2], making it incredibly compact. 

To run the following Fortran code you can either use [the playground](https://play.fortran-lang.org/) or install [gfortran](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/), store the code in a `.f90` file and then run it using `gfortran <filename>.g90 -o <filename>` and then run `./<filename>` (I used version `11.4.0`).
