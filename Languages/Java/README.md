# Bits & Peiecs i've learned About Java
![Java Logo](https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Java_logo_icon.png) [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is a language developed by [Oracle](https://oracle.com), it is used primarily in enterprise application, android application, and game development.

## Basic Language Anatomy

Typing; [Static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#STATIC)

Paradigm(s); Primarily [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)(Typically every file is a class in java), [Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and many more...

Compiled/Interpreted; [Compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK)

Package/Module Manager; Third party options: [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) NOTE: These systems don't only do package management, they are build clients.

Built-in Types; [integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, strings,](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) [arrays,](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html) [Hashmaps](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html), etc...

Difficulty; Beyond syntax, and some poor language decisions (like package management, and encouraged project structure) the language itself is relatively simple to learn. Generally Java is used as an introductory programming language for this reason, and it's widespread usage in industry. While I would still recommend Python over Java in a heartbeat, Java is still an excellent and relatively simple language to learn/start with.
