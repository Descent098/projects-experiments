[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a language created by the [PSF](https://www.python.org/psf/)(Python Software foundation). It is [open source](https://github.com/python) and was originally designed as a scripting language to be used in place of [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

Built-in Types; [integers, floating-point numbers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_numbers.htm), [booleans](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/python/boolean.html), [Lists](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm), [strings](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm), [Dictionary](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm), etc...

Difficulty; Python is very easy to learn how to use for almost any task, that being said the difficulty with python is choosing when is the best and worst times to use it. Because it is an interpreted and dynamic language it is relatively slow, and optimization can take having a deep level understanding of the language before things can run as quickly as basic applications in other languages. As such it is typically a good idea to use python for smaller tasks while learning and leave large scale application development to other languages that are 'faster by defualt'. That being said once you are familiar with python it is incredibly versatile, for everything from [data science](https://www.anaconda.com/), to [automation](https://www.seleniumhq.org/), to [web development](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), python has something to work with. It should also be noted that python takes 'a consenting adults language' approach; The language will let you do things that can be problematic, and it is up to you as a developer to know the ramifications more than in a language like Java that would just throw a compile time error.
