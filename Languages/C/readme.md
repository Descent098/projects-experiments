C is a general purpose language designed for low-level programming, and to be machine agnostic. It is often used in operating systems programming. C (along with assembly) has been used as the basis for [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) based operating systems (Such as linux and macOS).

## Useful Starter Resources
