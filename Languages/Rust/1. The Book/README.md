# The book

This repo is for the code as I go through the [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) which is a rust introduction that's first party supported.

## Rust installation

### *nix

run ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh```

### windows

On Windows, go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and follow the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later. The easiest way to acquire the build tools is to install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). When asked which workloads to install make sure "C++ build tools" is selected and that the Windows 10 SDK and the English language pack components are included.
