# Semaphore

A simple implementation of a semaphore using POSIX primatives. This package will not run in windows as far as I can tell, I had to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to get it to work.

To run with [race detector](https://go.dev/doc/articles/race_detector) run using `go test -race`
